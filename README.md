## Program to work with DA bimodules and their Hochschild homology
This software accompanies the paper ["Comparing homological invariants for mapping classes of surfaces"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.04071). Find below instructions to run the program

0. Install python3 (you may have it already, run `which python3` in your terminal to see).

1. [Download]() this program.

2. Open terminal, and change your location to the folder downloaded on the previous step.

3. Run the program by typing the following command:
```python3 run showcase1```
If you want to see another showcase (these are particular showcases referenced in the ["paper"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.04071)), simply run
```python3 run showcaseN```
where N is the number of the showcase.
