## Program to work with DA bimodules and their Hochschild homology
This software accompanies the paper ["Comparing homological invariants for mapping classes of surfaces"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.04071). Instructions to run the program:

0. Install python3 (you may have it already, run `which python3` in your terminal to see).

1. [Download](https://github.com/artofkot/comparing_mc/archive/master.zip) this program.

2. Open terminal, and change your location to the folder downloaded on the previous step.

3. Run the program by typing the following command:
```python3 run.py showcase1```<br />
If you want to see another showcase (these are particular showcases referenced in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.04071)), simply run
```python3 run.py showcaseN```
where N is the number of the showcase.
